        <h1>My Info</h1>
        <p>I'm Madhesh, and I was born and raised in a town with a close-knit community. From a young age, I was always curious about how things worked and loved taking apart gadgets to see what was inside.</p>
        <p>As I grew older, my interest in technology only deepened. I spent a lot of time reading books, watching tutorials, and experimenting with different coding projects</p>
        <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, photography, and spendding time with friends and family. Nature is where I find peace, and I love capturing beautiful landscapes through my camera lens.</p>
        <p>Now, I'm preparing for the next big step in my journey-college. I'm excited to meet new people, explore new subjects, and work toward a career in software development. I believe in continuous learning and always doing my best.</p>
